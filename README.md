<h1 align="center">ðŸš— Car Delivery ðŸ“¦</h1>

Hello there! This little game was created to enhance the learning resources of the  **[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)**. I followed the concept of a [Unity3D course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/) called 'Car Delivery Game', and most of the sprites were provided by the course hosts; all credits go to them. The game showcased in the course was simpler than the version I'm working on; I plan to incorporate new features such as a boost for the car, a start menu with level selection, and additional HUD elements while driving.
